# Algorithms-Data-Analysis
All of my code from my Algorithms and Data Analysis course

All of the problems come from [here](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=algorithmic-heights)

Everything in tests is either a test that Rosalind gave me, or a test I made and used on my code

Some programs are still a work in progress, others are completed. Pretty much all of them can definitely be optimized more and I will be doing that!
